## Reading Books
- [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) by Andrew Trask. Use our exclusive discount code **traskud17** for 40% off. This provides a very gentle introduction to Deep Learning and covers the intuition more than the theory.


- [Neural Networks And Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen. This book is more rigorous than Grokking Deep Learning and includes a lot of fun, interactive visualizations to play with.


- [The Deep Learning Textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) from Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This online book contains a lot of material and is the most rigorous of the three books suggested.
- Artificial Intelligence

## Reading Blogs

- From Andrej Karpathy:  [Yes, you should understand backprop](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b#.vt3ax2kg9)
- Also from Andrej Karpathy, [a lecture from Stanford's CS231n course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59Hbtz7XgjM)
